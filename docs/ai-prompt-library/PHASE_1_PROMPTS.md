- Sales pipeline tracking
- Reporting endpoints

Task Service:
- Task creation and assignment
- Status updates and completion
- Due date management

Include proper HTTP methods, status codes, and response formats.
```

**Purpose:** To design comprehensive REST APIs for all CRM services.

**Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Defined clear API endpoints
- Specified appropriate HTTP methods
- Included proper status codes
- Designed consistent response formats

**Learning:** Structured API design leads to better developer experience.

### 4. Security Design Prompts

#### Prompt 1.5: Security Architecture
**Prompt Used:**
```
Design security architecture for a CRM system with the following requirements:

Authentication:
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Token refresh mechanism

Authorization Roles:
- ADMIN: Full system access
- SALES_MANAGER: Team and pipeline management
- SALES_REP: Assigned customers and leads
- USER: Basic task access

Security Patterns:
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

Follow Spring Security best practices.
```

**Purpose:** To design comprehensive security architecture for the CRM system.

**Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Defined clear security roles
- Specified authentication mechanisms
- Included security patterns
- Followed Spring Security conventions

**Learning:** Security-first design leads to more robust systems.

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture Prompts

#### Prompt 1.6: Event Design
**Prompt Used:**
```
Design event-driven architecture for a CRM system with the following events:

Customer Events:
- customer.created
- customer.updated
- customer.deleted

Lead Events:
- lead.created
- lead.stage.changed
- lead.assigned
- lead.closed

Task Events:
- task.created
- task.assigned
- task.completed
- task.due.soon

Define event structure, payload, and consumer responsibilities.
```

**Purpose:** To design event-driven communication patterns for the CRM system.

**Effectiveness:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Defined comprehensive event types
- Specified event structure
- Mapped consumer responsibilities
- Ensured loose coupling

**Learning:** Event-driven design promotes scalability and maintainability.

## Prompt Effectiveness Analysis

### Most Effective Prompts
1. **Architecture Analysis** (1.1) - Perfect for understanding existing patterns
2. **Entity Design** (1.3) - Comprehensive and detailed requirements
3. **Security Architecture** (1.5) - Clear security requirements

### Areas for Improvement
1. **More specific requirements** - Some prompts could be more detailed
2. **Validation criteria** - Include success metrics in prompts
3. **Iterative refinement** - Break complex prompts into smaller steps
